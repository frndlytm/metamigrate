# To Do

1. Build out the interface for how commands are executed from the CLI. This is of utmost importance because it helps inform how and what to expose when building Tables and Columns for redering.

2. Construct a standard config file structure for loading from configuration.

3. Finish the builder classes, or whatever design pattern makes the most sense, for generating Table and Field objects.

4. Finalize removing managers.py from root by whatever means necessary.
